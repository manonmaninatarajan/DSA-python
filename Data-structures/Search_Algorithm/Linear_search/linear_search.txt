Linear Search Algorithm:
Linear search traverses through every element sequentially therefore, the best case is when the element is found in the very first iteration. The best-case time complexity would be O(1).However, the worst case of the linear search method would be an unsuccessful search that does not find the key value in the array, it performs n iterations. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of the linear search algorithm would be O(n).

The algorithm for linear search is relatively simple. The procedure starts at the very first index of the input array to be searched.

Step 1 − Start from the 0th index of the input array, compare the key value with the value present in the 0th index.

Step 2 − If the value matches with the key, return the position at which the value was found.

Step 3 − If the value does not match with the key, compare the next element in the array.

Step 4 − Repeat Step 3 until there is a match found. Return the position at which the match was found.

Step 5 − If it is an unsuccessful search, print that the element is not present in the array and exit the program.


psudo code:
procedure linear_search (list, value)
   for each item in the list
      if match item == value
         return the item's location
      end if
   end for
end procedure
