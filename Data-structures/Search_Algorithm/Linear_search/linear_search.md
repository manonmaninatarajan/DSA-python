This Python code implements the Linear Search algorithm, which searches for a specific value in a list.

Explanation of the Code:

1. Printing the Algorithm Name
   ```python
   print("Linear search algorithm")
   print()
   ```
   - Displays the text "Linear search algorithm" on the console.

2. Defining the Linear Search Function
   ```python
   def linear_search(arr, value, j):
   ```
   - This function performs a linear search on the given list `arr` to find the position(s) of `value`.
   - Parameters:
     - `arr`: The list to search.
     - `value`: The value to look for in the list.
     - `j`: The length of the list.

3. Iterating Through the List
   ```python
   for i in range(j):
       if arr[i] == value:
           print(i)
       else:
           continue
   ```
   - A `for` loop iterates through the list indices (from `0` to `j-1`).
   - If the value at the current index matches `value`, the index is printed.
   - If there is no match, the loop continues to the next iteration.

4. Defining the Array and Searching for a Value
   ```python
   ans = [1, 2, 23, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
   j = len(ans)
   value = int(input("Enter the value to search"))
   linear_search(ans, value, j)
   ```
   - `ans` is a predefined list containing integers.
   - `j` stores the length of the list.
   - The user inputs the `value` they wish to search for, and it is passed along with `ans` and `j` to the `linear_search` function.

Key Notes:
- This implementation prints all indices where the searched `value` is found.
- If the `value` is not present in the list, the function doesn't print anything.
- Linear search is simple but has a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the list.
